- 👋 Hi, I’m @JackDarkability
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming, Spanish and video games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and C++ mainly, however also dabbling in other languages.
- 📫 The best way to reach me will be probably through here at the moment.
- 📂 I'll be using this as a portfolio for any programs that I make in my free time, they also might be useful to people.
