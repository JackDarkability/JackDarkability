- Hi, I’m Jack Newton
- I’m interested in Programming, Spanish and video games
- I’m currently learning Java and C++ mainly, however also dabbling in other languages such as Haskell.
- My best programming language is Python
- The best way to reach me will be probably through here at the moment.
- I'll be using this as a portfolio for any programs that I make in my free time, they also might be useful to people

My list of languages that I am familiar with at this moment (In order of most to least experienced) is:
- Python
- JavaScript
- HTML
- AutoHotKey
- Java
- C++
- Haskell
